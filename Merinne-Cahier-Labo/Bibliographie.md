### Article 1: Cell-type-specific gene expression profiling in adult Mouse brain reveals Normal and disase-state signatures
***
Method less stressful for cells to dissec & investigate  cellular specificty trasncriptome & chip-seq. => Opposite epigenetic govern transcriptionnal regulation of neurones & glial cells -> compensatory mechanisms.  
HD up gene: more represented in glia  
HD down genes more represented in neurones  

### Article 2: Huntington desease  
***
More prevalent in some pop: europ > asia > africa  
\> 36 CAG: desease  
27-35: depends of the person + de novo  
CAG repeat: gain of function for huntingtin  
Function of normal huntingtin are known  
Toxic gain of function -> critical conformational changes ?
