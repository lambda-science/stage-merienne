- In Huntington's disease (HD), the striatum in the brain is primarily affected, but the reason of striatum selectivity is still obscure. Are mHTT interactors particularly expressed in the striatum? Are they enriched in specific striatal cell populations (neurons vs glial cells; D1R neurons vs D2R neurons vs astrocytes vs microglia)? Cell type specific striatal database (by Nicole Deglon, paper Merienne Cell Reports 2019) can be used to address the question, as well as cell type specific epigenomic database generated by Rafael (to assess whether mHTT interactors have specific epigenetic signature).

- Huge epigenetic and transcriptional changes associate with disease progression, particularly in the striatum. This includes changes in H3K27ac. Do H3K27ac levels of mHTT interactors particularly change over time? (intersection with ChIPseq data generated by Rafael, using the striatum of HD Q140 knockin mice of 2 and 6 months)

- The mechanism underlying altered epigenetic and transcriptional regulations in HD remain unclear. Are mHTT interactors enriched in gene ontologies linked to chromatin remodeling, epigenetic regulation, transcription... ?

- HD leads to behavioral symptoms, including learning and memory deficits (involving synaptic plasticity processes). Are mHTT interactors particularly implicated in such mechanisms ? Are mHTT interactors modulated by learning/memory? (RNAseq data generated by Caroline, using the striatum of HD R6/1 mice during learning can be used)
